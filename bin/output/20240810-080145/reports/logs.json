Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Mr. Altman, there\u2019s a robot for you on the other line. Sam Altman says being fired from OpenAI by his own board was a blessing in 2023, I wonder if indebted Americans will feel the same way about AI taking their job in 2024 and 2025? While OpenAI tries to talk about AGI or ASI, the reality is in 2024 we are likely to see many more layoffs directly due to their GPT technology. A not insignificant number of these will be due to AI and many of those will be directly related to ChatGPT and its products. That Microsoft decided to fund such a project to get first access to their tech, that will directly lead to many job layoffs is not very good for their reputation moving forwards. The lobbying against this being revealed has already begun. While OpenAI makes exciting claims and promises about its technology, even in a 'soft landing' scenario, AI will continue to take more jobs. Not to mention how America\u2019s choices have wreaked havoc to economies from China to Germany, some of the world\u2019s more important economies. America\u2019s gains in 2023 and 2024, are going to be the world\u2019s pains. What a just world OpenAI is bringing to us. But what about layoffs due to A.I.? This year I\u2019ve covered many reports on the future of jobs. This even as OpenAI does its best to distract us from the key concerns. But how many job losses and layoffs will OpenAI be directly responsible for next year in 2024 in America and abroad, or in the 2020s itself and the future at large? While the U.S. might not release that data, it\u2019s going to be a considerable and increasing number. Here\u2019s why:\n######################\noutput:"}}

Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

The Biden Administration's move was a real attempt to hobble China's capacity for training AI systems at scale. Matt Sheehan described the move as a bet, and in a conversation with me asked whether China might yet be able to do something interesting with trailing-edge (not state-of-the-art) chips. Indeed, a WSJ review of research papers and employee interviews found that Chinese researchers are looking at ways to face restrictions by using fewer or less powerful semiconductors to train state-of-the-art AI systems. While companies such as Baidu stockpiled A100 chips before the US rules came into effect, they have heavily restricted internal use and reserved these chips only for the most computationally intensive tasks.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # U.S. Sanctions Drive Chinese Firms to Advance AI Without Latest Chips \n It has been months since the US imposed extensive restrictions on China's access to advanced semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The Biden Administration's move was a real attempt to hobble China's capacity for training AI systems at scale. Matt Sheehan described the move as a bet, and in a conversation with me asked whether China might yet be able to do something interesting with trailing-edge (not state-of-the-art) chips. Indeed, a WSJ review of research papers and employee interviews found that Chinese researchers are looking at ways to face restrictions by using fewer or less powerful semiconductors to train state-of-the-art AI systems. While companies such as Baidu stockpiled A100 chips before the US rules came into effect, they have heavily restricted internal use and reserved these chips only for the most computationally intensive tasks.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # GenAI to increase marketing productivity by more than 40% by 2029, says IDC \n New research from IDC shows that applying generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to a range of enterprise marketing tasks will result in an estimated productivity increase of more than 40% by 2029.digitimes.com\n######################\noutput:"}}

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more).

The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Over the next decade, intelligent, embodied androids will permeate industrial activities and aspects of everyday life, from assembling cars to folding laundry. The impending robot \u201cpopulation boom\u201d is the result of technological breakthroughs, intense investor appetite, labor cost arbitrage, and long-standing demographic trends. Modern AI models have changed the game. The same deep learning and neural techniques that have powered the generative AI revolution are helping robotics overcome one of its major limitations: a lack of training data. In the past, if you wanted to teach a robot to pick up a yellow block and place it in a blue bin, it had to learn through trial and error or extensive videos. New foundation models allow robots to learn from online text, images, and videos. Generative AI can create new data to tackle edge cases. One of the challenges of operating in the physical world is the sheer volume of strange, niche possibilities. While AI thrives in decoding the fixed rules of chess or language patterns, it has historically struggled to account for real-world edge cases. Not only do new models help with this kind of \u201cthinking,\u201d they can also create new, relevant data to train on. Investors are looking for the next bonanza. Venture capitalists have aggressively invested in AI over the past few years, pouring billions into companies making new foundation models or building applications on top of them. As some of those well-capitalized startups close their doors, there is a growing itch to find the next great AI opportunity. Robotics is the beneficiary. Robots aren\u2019t that fussy about pay. A recent MIT study attempted to paint a rosy portrait of AI\u2019s impact on the workforce by saying \u201conly\u201d 23% of wages paid would be \u201ceconomically viable\u201d to automate. That figure will only increase as hardware costs decline and robots become increasingly intelligent. California\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour and other similar initiatives may accelerate the shift. Major economies lack sufficient working humans. America doesn\u2019t have a large enough working-age population to support its young and elderly. The increase in the US\u2019s \u201cdependency ratio\u201d is not unique \u2013 many other advanced countries face similar slumps. While immigration is one solution, robots are another. What can new robots do? Google\u2019s RT-2 model best demonstrates what this new class of robotics is capable of. When an engineer prompted Google\u2019s test robot to select the \u201cextinct animal\u201d from a range of dollar store figurines it had never seen before, it correctly selected a plastic dinosaur. The model\u2019s ability to adapt to a new environment with new variables, generalize, and reason is novel and opens up huge possibilities. Modern robots are no longer constrained to a narrow pre-programmed problem. Beyond RT-2, a range of robotics makers are demonstrating commercial utility across sectors from logistics to manufacturing to construction. Who are the major players? Google\u2019s cutting-edge RT-2 model demonstrates the search monolith\u2019s impressive AI research bonafides. Its DeepMind division is driving the technology forward and will continue to play a vital role. While we wouldn\u2019t expect Google worker robots any time soon, autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo illustrates how the company applies artificial intelligence in the physical world. OpenAI disbanded its robotics division in 2021, citing a lack of progress. It remains an important player in the space, investing in startups like Figure and Physical Intelligence. After being cut loose, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team founded Covariant, a maker of a robotics \u201cbrain\u201d and physical setups for sorting items, assembling them into kits, and more. Amazon is a long-time customer and acquirer in the robotics space. After acquiring Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, the firm created a dedicated Amazon Robotics division that has continued investing in the space and trialing new solutions. Amazon is conducting one such trial with Agility, maker of the \u201cDigit\u201d humanoid robot, which it touts as \u201cthe first human-centric, multi-purpose robot made for logistics work.\u201d Agility seems confident there\u2019s demand for its products, announcing a plan to produce 10,000 per year via a new \u201cRoboFab\u201d in Oregon. Tesla\u2019s \u201cOptimus\u201d robot attracted skepticism when first unveiled, but it seems to be improving quickly. Earlier this year, Elon Musk shared a video of Optimus gently folding a shirt, displaying its dexterity. On a recent earnings call, Musk said he expected Optimus to be operational in Tesla\u2019s factories before the end of the year and available for purchase by 2025. Figure, 1X, Agility, Apptronik, and Sanctuary are all building humanoid robotics, some of which are finally ready to leave their home factory and find gainful employment. Figure\u2019s 5\u20196 worker is headed to BMW\u2019s production lines and, as mentioned, Agility is sending its units off to Amazon. Apptronik\u2019s androids are slated for a longer journey: via a partnership with NASA, the company intends to send its robots to space to assist astronauts. What about Boston Dynamics? Though no one makes better sizzle reels of robot parkour, Boston Dynamics has struggled to find commercial applications for its dexterous machines. In many ways, they represent the pinnacle of old-world robotics: extremely well-tuned machines that struggle to generalize or solve new problems. Who else should you keep an eye on? Monumental is reversing the construction industry\u2019s \u201cproductivity collapse\u201d with non-humanoid robots. The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army\n######################\noutput:"}}

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Elon Musk to Deploy Humanoid Robots for Internal Use in Tesla Factories by Next Year \n Elon Musk said on Monday that Tesla will have humanoid robots in \"low production\" for the company's internal use next year.

Over the next decade, intelligent, embodied androids will permeate industrial activities and aspects of everyday life, from assembling cars to folding laundry. The impending robot \u201cpopulation boom\u201d is the result of technological breakthroughs, intense investor appetite, labor cost arbitrage, and long-standing demographic trends. Modern AI models have changed the game. The same deep learning and neural techniques that have powered the generative AI revolution are helping robotics overcome one of its major limitations: a lack of training data. In the past, if you wanted to teach a robot to pick up a yellow block and place it in a blue bin, it had to learn through trial and error or extensive videos. New foundation models allow robots to learn from online text, images, and videos. Generative AI can create new data to tackle edge cases. One of the challenges of operating in the physical world is the sheer volume of strange, niche possibilities. While AI thrives in decoding the fixed rules of chess or language patterns, it has historically struggled to account for real-world edge cases. Not only do new models help with this kind of \u201cthinking,\u201d they can also create new, relevant data to train on. Investors are looking for the next bonanza. Venture capitalists have aggressively invested in AI over the past few years, pouring billions into companies making new foundation models or building applications on top of them. As some of those well-capitalized startups close their doors, there is a growing itch to find the next great AI opportunity. Robotics is the beneficiary. Robots aren\u2019t that fussy about pay. A recent MIT study attempted to paint a rosy portrait of AI\u2019s impact on the workforce by saying \u201conly\u201d 23% of wages paid would be \u201ceconomically viable\u201d to automate. That figure will only increase as hardware costs decline and robots become increasingly intelligent. California\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour and other similar initiatives may accelerate the shift. Major economies lack sufficient working humans. America doesn\u2019t have a large enough working-age population to support its young and elderly. The increase in the US\u2019s \u201cdependency ratio\u201d is not unique \u2013 many other advanced countries face similar slumps. While immigration is one solution, robots are another. What can new robots do? Google\u2019s RT-2 model best demonstrates what this new class of robotics is capable of. When an engineer prompted Google\u2019s test robot to select the \u201cextinct animal\u201d from a range of dollar store figurines it had never seen before, it correctly selected a plastic dinosaur. The model\u2019s ability to adapt to a new environment with new variables, generalize, and reason is novel and opens up huge possibilities. Modern robots are no longer constrained to a narrow pre-programmed problem. Beyond RT-2, a range of robotics makers are demonstrating commercial utility across sectors from logistics to manufacturing to construction. Who are the major players? Google\u2019s cutting-edge RT-2 model demonstrates the search monolith\u2019s impressive AI research bonafides. Its DeepMind division is driving the technology forward and will continue to play a vital role. While we wouldn\u2019t expect Google worker robots any time soon, autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo illustrates how the company applies artificial intelligence in the physical world. OpenAI disbanded its robotics division in 2021, citing a lack of progress. It remains an important player in the space, investing in startups like Figure and Physical Intelligence. After being cut loose, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team founded Covariant, a maker of a robotics \u201cbrain\u201d and physical setups for sorting items, assembling them into kits, and more. Amazon is a long-time customer and acquirer in the robotics space. After acquiring Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, the firm created a dedicated Amazon Robotics division that has continued investing in the space and trialing new solutions. Amazon is conducting one such trial with Agility, maker of the \u201cDigit\u201d humanoid robot, which it touts as \u201cthe first human-centric, multi-purpose robot made for logistics work.\u201d Agility seems confident there\u2019s demand for its products, announcing a plan to produce 10,000 per year via a new \u201cRoboFab\u201d in Oregon. Tesla\u2019s \u201cOptimus\u201d robot attracted skepticism when first unveiled, but it seems to be improving quickly. Earlier this year, Elon Musk shared a video of Optimus gently folding a shirt, displaying its dexterity. On a recent earnings call, Musk said he expected Optimus to be operational in Tesla\u2019s factories before the end of the year and available for purchase by 2025. Figure, 1X, Agility, Apptronik, and Sanctuary are all building humanoid robotics, some of which are finally ready to leave their home factory and find gainful employment. Figure\u2019s 5\u20196 worker is headed to BMW\u2019s production lines and, as mentioned, Agility is sending its units off to Amazon. Apptronik\u2019s androids are slated for a longer journey: via a partnership with NASA, the company intends to send its robots to space to assist astronauts. What about Boston Dynamics? Though no one makes better sizzle reels of robot parkour, Boston Dynamics has struggled to find commercial applications for its dexterous machines. In many ways, they represent the pinnacle of old-world robotics: extremely well-tuned machines that struggle to generalize or solve new problems. Who else should you keep an eye on? Monumental is reversing the construction industry\u2019s \u201cproductivity collapse\u201d with non-humanoid robots. The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army\n######################\noutput:"}}

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # AI is a Services Revolution \n This article discusses the impact of LLMs on the service economy, particularly on knowledge work sectors such as legal, healthcare, and education. While rapid AI advancements suggest significant automation potential, the adoption by enterprises is slow, with many still in the experimentation phase. Actual deployment is expected to be gradual.

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Accelerating Transformers with NVIDIA cuDNN 9 \n The NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN) is a GPU-accelerated library for accelerating deep learning primitives with state-of-the-art performance. cuDNN is integrated with popular deep\u2026developer.nvidia.com Read More\n######################\noutput:"}}

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Safe Super-Intelligence Company \n OpenAI co-founder, Ilya Sutskever, has initiated a Safe Super-Intelligence company to advance AI research and development.

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Beyond Skynet: Crafting the Next Frontier in AI Evolution \n The article discusses the value of reliable data, democratizing access to valuable data insights, and consumer privacy\u2019s impact on the competitive edge of big tech.

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Elon Musk Says His AI Startup xAI's Grok Chatbot Will Go Open-Source \n Elon Musk said on Monday his artificial intelligence startup xAI would open-source its ChatGPT challenger \"Grok\" this week, days after he sued OpenAI for abandoning its original mission in favor of a for-profit model.\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems.

This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

Over the next decade, intelligent, embodied androids will permeate industrial activities and aspects of everyday life, from assembling cars to folding laundry. The impending robot \u201cpopulation boom\u201d is the result of technological breakthroughs, intense investor appetite, labor cost arbitrage, and long-standing demographic trends. Modern AI models have changed the game. The same deep learning and neural techniques that have powered the generative AI revolution are helping robotics overcome one of its major limitations: a lack of training data. In the past, if you wanted to teach a robot to pick up a yellow block and place it in a blue bin, it had to learn through trial and error or extensive videos. New foundation models allow robots to learn from online text, images, and videos. Generative AI can create new data to tackle edge cases. One of the challenges of operating in the physical world is the sheer volume of strange, niche possibilities. While AI thrives in decoding the fixed rules of chess or language patterns, it has historically struggled to account for real-world edge cases. Not only do new models help with this kind of \u201cthinking,\u201d they can also create new, relevant data to train on. Investors are looking for the next bonanza. Venture capitalists have aggressively invested in AI over the past few years, pouring billions into companies making new foundation models or building applications on top of them. As some of those well-capitalized startups close their doors, there is a growing itch to find the next great AI opportunity. Robotics is the beneficiary. Robots aren\u2019t that fussy about pay. A recent MIT study attempted to paint a rosy portrait of AI\u2019s impact on the workforce by saying \u201conly\u201d 23% of wages paid would be \u201ceconomically viable\u201d to automate. That figure will only increase as hardware costs decline and robots become increasingly intelligent. California\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour and other similar initiatives may accelerate the shift. Major economies lack sufficient working humans. America doesn\u2019t have a large enough working-age population to support its young and elderly. The increase in the US\u2019s \u201cdependency ratio\u201d is not unique \u2013 many other advanced countries face similar slumps. While immigration is one solution, robots are another. What can new robots do? Google\u2019s RT-2 model best demonstrates what this new class of robotics is capable of. When an engineer prompted Google\u2019s test robot to select the \u201cextinct animal\u201d from a range of dollar store figurines it had never seen before, it correctly selected a plastic dinosaur. The model\u2019s ability to adapt to a new environment with new variables, generalize, and reason is novel and opens up huge possibilities. Modern robots are no longer constrained to a narrow pre-programmed problem. Beyond RT-2, a range of robotics makers are demonstrating commercial utility across sectors from logistics to manufacturing to construction. Who are the major players? Google\u2019s cutting-edge RT-2 model demonstrates the search monolith\u2019s impressive AI research bonafides. Its DeepMind division is driving the technology forward and will continue to play a vital role. While we wouldn\u2019t expect Google worker robots any time soon, autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo illustrates how the company applies artificial intelligence in the physical world. OpenAI disbanded its robotics division in 2021, citing a lack of progress. It remains an important player in the space, investing in startups like Figure and Physical Intelligence. After being cut loose, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team founded Covariant, a maker of a robotics \u201cbrain\u201d and physical setups for sorting items, assembling them into kits, and more. Amazon is a long-time customer and acquirer in the robotics space. After acquiring Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, the firm created a dedicated Amazon Robotics division that has continued investing in the space and trialing new solutions. Amazon is conducting one such trial with Agility, maker of the \u201cDigit\u201d humanoid robot, which it touts as \u201cthe first human-centric, multi-purpose robot made for logistics work.\u201d Agility seems confident there\u2019s demand for its products, announcing a plan to produce 10,000 per year via a new \u201cRoboFab\u201d in Oregon. Tesla\u2019s \u201cOptimus\u201d robot attracted skepticism when first unveiled, but it seems to be improving quickly. Earlier this year, Elon Musk shared a video of Optimus gently folding a shirt, displaying its dexterity. On a recent earnings call, Musk said he expected Optimus to be operational in Tesla\u2019s factories before the end of the year and available for purchase by 2025. Figure, 1X, Agility, Apptronik, and Sanctuary are all building humanoid robotics, some of which are finally ready to leave their home factory and find gainful employment. Figure\u2019s 5\u20196 worker is headed to BMW\u2019s production lines and, as mentioned, Agility is sending its units off to Amazon. Apptronik\u2019s androids are slated for a longer journey: via a partnership with NASA, the company intends to send its robots to space to assist astronauts. What about Boston Dynamics? Though no one makes better sizzle reels of robot parkour, Boston Dynamics has struggled to find commercial applications for its dexterous machines. In many ways, they represent the pinnacle of old-world robotics: extremely well-tuned machines that struggle to generalize or solve new problems. Who else should you keep an eye on? Monumental is reversing the construction industry\u2019s \u201cproductivity collapse\u201d with non-humanoid robots. The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army\n######################\noutput:"}}

Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more).

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # What I learned from the UN\u2019s \u201cAI for Good\u201d summit \n This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

But it's still unclear exactly how. Dust is on a mission to figure that out. Since LLMs won't be of much help in the enterprise if they don't have access to internal data, Dust has built a platform that indexes, embeds, and keeps updated in real-time companies' internal data (Notion, Slack, Drive, GitHub) to expose it to LLM-backed products.\nDust co-founders Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu sold a company to Stripe and worked there for five years. They witnessed firsthand how fast-growing companies can struggle with scale. They've seen what they call \"information debt\" creep in, and they're now focused on applying LLMs to solve some of the major pain points associated with that. They're currently exploring the following applications on top of their platform:\nAnswer engine. The focus is on factuality, as it's a key to broad adoption.\nCompositional assistant. Templated assistance at the time of content creation. For example, generate the paragraph you're missing based on internal data.\nDocuments that update themselves. Document owners receive notifications and a pre-crafted recommendation each time a piece of information that should update their document floats through the company.\nStructured event extraction. Users can generate structured events from unstructured data (e.g., a Slack thread) based on predefined templates.\nInternal data monitoring. Monitor enterprise data with intelligent rules. For example, receive alerts if personally identifiable information (PII) inadvertently ends up where it should not be.\nIt's a lot, but Dust's founders believe most of these streams will ultimately contribute to one coherent product. They're still in the early days of their exploration and are forming the final focused picture of what Dust will be. Based on their initial iterations, they believe they've confirmed their core hypothesis: that knowledge workers can be augmented (not replaced) with LLM applications that have access to company data, and a new kind of \"team operating system\" can be built for that.\n- Konstantine Buhler, Partner at Sequoia\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

And what kinds of defenses? \n What kinds of threats do generative AI systems contain and how might we defend against or mitigate them? That's the subject of a new paper born out of a workshop held at Google in June of this year. The researchers who contributed to the paper come from Google, the University of Wisconsin, University of California, San Diego, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, Berkeley, University of Waterloo University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Stanford University, DARPA, the Center for AI Safety, Aura Labs. The motivation for the paper is that today's large-scale AI systems are sufficiently powerful that they either compound or create new threats to safety. Some of the key risks posed by generative AI technologies include: Improved 'spear-phishing' attacks Aiding the creation and dissemination of deepfakes Increasing the amount of cyberattacks being conducted by making it easier for people to do them (e.g, via code models) Reducing the barrier-of-entry for adversaries generally - general technologies make things generally cheaper. Data poisoning - you can generate and insert bad data into an environment that other people train on, silently corrupting systems. The authors also list some ways in which generative AI systems can be used to give us more defenses against these attacks. These include: Systems for detecting LLM-generated content. Systems for watermarking the outputs of generative models broadly. Using code models to perform automated penetration testing to help strengthen complicated, digital infrastructures. Multimodal analysis; use the multimodal capabilities of AI models to do complex analysis on potential attackers, such as by identifying bot accounts on social media The paper concludes with some ideas for what we should do to generally increase the safety of both the AI ecosystem and the wider world.\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Elon Musk to Deploy Humanoid Robots for Internal Use in Tesla Factories by Next Year \n Elon Musk said on Monday that Tesla will have humanoid robots in \"low production\" for the company's internal use next year.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4.

The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

Gemma models share infrastructure components with Gemini models. Gemma 2B and 7B models are trained on 2T and 6T tokens of text, respectively. The data for training is primarily English from web documents, mathematics, and code. Gemma models are designed for CPU and on-device applications (2B model) and GPU and TPU deployment (7B model). These are pre-trained and fine-tuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety. Gemma models outperform similarly sized open models on 11 out of 18 text-based tasks. Performance is evaluated across language understanding, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. Google emphasizes safety and reliability in Gemma's pre-trained models and uses automated techniques to filter sensitive data from training sets. Models are fine-tuned and reinforced with human feedback for responsible behaviors with extensive evaluations being conducted, including manual red-teaming and adversarial testing. Responsible Generative AI Toolkit is released with Gemma for safe AI application development. It includes safety classification methodology, model debugging tools, and best practice guidance. Supports multi-framework tools like Keras 3.0, PyTorch, JAX, and Hugging Face Transformers. Also, compatible across laptops, desktops, IoT, mobile, and cloud. Gemma models are released on Hugging Face along with inference code and the code for fine-tuning the models. Gemma 7B seems to be a new model that outperforms LLAMA-2 7B and Mistral 7B on several benchmarks, despite having the same number of parameters.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs.

But it's still unclear exactly how. Dust is on a mission to figure that out. Since LLMs won't be of much help in the enterprise if they don't have access to internal data, Dust has built a platform that indexes, embeds, and keeps updated in real-time companies' internal data (Notion, Slack, Drive, GitHub) to expose it to LLM-backed products.\nDust co-founders Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu sold a company to Stripe and worked there for five years. They witnessed firsthand how fast-growing companies can struggle with scale. They've seen what they call \"information debt\" creep in, and they're now focused on applying LLMs to solve some of the major pain points associated with that. They're currently exploring the following applications on top of their platform:\nAnswer engine. The focus is on factuality, as it's a key to broad adoption.\nCompositional assistant. Templated assistance at the time of content creation. For example, generate the paragraph you're missing based on internal data.\nDocuments that update themselves. Document owners receive notifications and a pre-crafted recommendation each time a piece of information that should update their document floats through the company.\nStructured event extraction. Users can generate structured events from unstructured data (e.g., a Slack thread) based on predefined templates.\nInternal data monitoring. Monitor enterprise data with intelligent rules. For example, receive alerts if personally identifiable information (PII) inadvertently ends up where it should not be.\nIt's a lot, but Dust's founders believe most of these streams will ultimately contribute to one coherent product. They're still in the early days of their exploration and are forming the final focused picture of what Dust will be. Based on their initial iterations, they believe they've confirmed their core hypothesis: that knowledge workers can be augmented (not replaced) with LLM applications that have access to company data, and a new kind of \"team operating system\" can be built for that.\n- Konstantine Buhler, Partner at Sequoia\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems.

And what kinds of defenses? \n What kinds of threats do generative AI systems contain and how might we defend against or mitigate them? That's the subject of a new paper born out of a workshop held at Google in June of this year. The researchers who contributed to the paper come from Google, the University of Wisconsin, University of California, San Diego, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, Berkeley, University of Waterloo University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Stanford University, DARPA, the Center for AI Safety, Aura Labs. The motivation for the paper is that today's large-scale AI systems are sufficiently powerful that they either compound or create new threats to safety. Some of the key risks posed by generative AI technologies include: Improved 'spear-phishing' attacks Aiding the creation and dissemination of deepfakes Increasing the amount of cyberattacks being conducted by making it easier for people to do them (e.g, via code models) Reducing the barrier-of-entry for adversaries generally - general technologies make things generally cheaper. Data poisoning - you can generate and insert bad data into an environment that other people train on, silently corrupting systems. The authors also list some ways in which generative AI systems can be used to give us more defenses against these attacks. These include: Systems for detecting LLM-generated content. Systems for watermarking the outputs of generative models broadly. Using code models to perform automated penetration testing to help strengthen complicated, digital infrastructures. Multimodal analysis; use the multimodal capabilities of AI models to do complex analysis on potential attackers, such as by identifying bot accounts on social media The paper concludes with some ideas for what we should do to generally increase the safety of both the AI ecosystem and the wider world.\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Elon Musk to Deploy Humanoid Robots for Internal Use in Tesla Factories by Next Year \n Elon Musk said on Monday that Tesla will have humanoid robots in \"low production\" for the company's internal use next year.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4.

The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

But it's still unclear exactly how. Dust is on a mission to figure that out. Since LLMs won't be of much help in the enterprise if they don't have access to internal data, Dust has built a platform that indexes, embeds, and keeps updated in real-time companies' internal data (Notion, Slack, Drive, GitHub) to expose it to LLM-backed products.\nDust co-founders Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu sold a company to Stripe and worked there for five years. They witnessed firsthand how fast-growing companies can struggle with scale. They've seen what they call \"information debt\" creep in, and they're now focused on applying LLMs to solve some of the major pain points associated with that. They're currently exploring the following applications on top of their platform:\nAnswer engine. The focus is on factuality, as it's a key to broad adoption.\nCompositional assistant. Templated assistance at the time of content creation. For example, generate the paragraph you're missing based on internal data.\nDocuments that update themselves. Document owners receive notifications and a pre-crafted recommendation each time a piece of information that should update their document floats through the company.\nStructured event extraction. Users can generate structured events from unstructured data (e.g., a Slack thread) based on predefined templates.\nInternal data monitoring. Monitor enterprise data with intelligent rules. For example, receive alerts if personally identifiable information (PII) inadvertently ends up where it should not be.\nIt's a lot, but Dust's founders believe most of these streams will ultimately contribute to one coherent product. They're still in the early days of their exploration and are forming the final focused picture of what Dust will be. Based on their initial iterations, they believe they've confirmed their core hypothesis: that knowledge workers can be augmented (not replaced) with LLM applications that have access to company data, and a new kind of \"team operating system\" can be built for that.\n- Konstantine Buhler, Partner at Sequoia\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

And what kinds of defenses? \n What kinds of threats do generative AI systems contain and how might we defend against or mitigate them? That's the subject of a new paper born out of a workshop held at Google in June of this year. The researchers who contributed to the paper come from Google, the University of Wisconsin, University of California, San Diego, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, Berkeley, University of Waterloo University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Stanford University, DARPA, the Center for AI Safety, Aura Labs. The motivation for the paper is that today's large-scale AI systems are sufficiently powerful that they either compound or create new threats to safety. Some of the key risks posed by generative AI technologies include: Improved 'spear-phishing' attacks Aiding the creation and dissemination of deepfakes Increasing the amount of cyberattacks being conducted by making it easier for people to do them (e.g, via code models) Reducing the barrier-of-entry for adversaries generally - general technologies make things generally cheaper. Data poisoning - you can generate and insert bad data into an environment that other people train on, silently corrupting systems. The authors also list some ways in which generative AI systems can be used to give us more defenses against these attacks. These include: Systems for detecting LLM-generated content. Systems for watermarking the outputs of generative models broadly. Using code models to perform automated penetration testing to help strengthen complicated, digital infrastructures. Multimodal analysis; use the multimodal capabilities of AI models to do complex analysis on potential attackers, such as by identifying bot accounts on social media The paper concludes with some ideas for what we should do to generally increase the safety of both the AI ecosystem and the wider world.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # What I learned from the UN\u2019s \u201cAI for Good\u201d summit \n This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong.

But it's still unclear exactly how. Dust is on a mission to figure that out. Since LLMs won't be of much help in the enterprise if they don't have access to internal data, Dust has built a platform that indexes, embeds, and keeps updated in real-time companies' internal data (Notion, Slack, Drive, GitHub) to expose it to LLM-backed products.\nDust co-founders Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu sold a company to Stripe and worked there for five years. They witnessed firsthand how fast-growing companies can struggle with scale. They've seen what they call \"information debt\" creep in, and they're now focused on applying LLMs to solve some of the major pain points associated with that. They're currently exploring the following applications on top of their platform:\nAnswer engine. The focus is on factuality, as it's a key to broad adoption.\nCompositional assistant. Templated assistance at the time of content creation. For example, generate the paragraph you're missing based on internal data.\nDocuments that update themselves. Document owners receive notifications and a pre-crafted recommendation each time a piece of information that should update their document floats through the company.\nStructured event extraction. Users can generate structured events from unstructured data (e.g., a Slack thread) based on predefined templates.\nInternal data monitoring. Monitor enterprise data with intelligent rules. For example, receive alerts if personally identifiable information (PII) inadvertently ends up where it should not be.\nIt's a lot, but Dust's founders believe most of these streams will ultimately contribute to one coherent product. They're still in the early days of their exploration and are forming the final focused picture of what Dust will be. Based on their initial iterations, they believe they've confirmed their core hypothesis: that knowledge workers can be augmented (not replaced) with LLM applications that have access to company data, and a new kind of \"team operating system\" can be built for that.\n- Konstantine Buhler, Partner at Sequoia\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

And what kinds of defenses? \n What kinds of threats do generative AI systems contain and how might we defend against or mitigate them? That's the subject of a new paper born out of a workshop held at Google in June of this year. The researchers who contributed to the paper come from Google, the University of Wisconsin, University of California, San Diego, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, Berkeley, University of Waterloo University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Stanford University, DARPA, the Center for AI Safety, Aura Labs. The motivation for the paper is that today's large-scale AI systems are sufficiently powerful that they either compound or create new threats to safety. Some of the key risks posed by generative AI technologies include: Improved 'spear-phishing' attacks Aiding the creation and dissemination of deepfakes Increasing the amount of cyberattacks being conducted by making it easier for people to do them (e.g, via code models) Reducing the barrier-of-entry for adversaries generally - general technologies make things generally cheaper. Data poisoning - you can generate and insert bad data into an environment that other people train on, silently corrupting systems. The authors also list some ways in which generative AI systems can be used to give us more defenses against these attacks. These include: Systems for detecting LLM-generated content. Systems for watermarking the outputs of generative models broadly. Using code models to perform automated penetration testing to help strengthen complicated, digital infrastructures. Multimodal analysis; use the multimodal capabilities of AI models to do complex analysis on potential attackers, such as by identifying bot accounts on social media The paper concludes with some ideas for what we should do to generally increase the safety of both the AI ecosystem and the wider world.\n######################\noutput:"}}

1.5 Pro \n Anthropic has released Claude 3.5 Sonnet succeeding the Claude 3 models family which came out just 3 months back. Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a context window of 200k tokens, and improves upon both speed and intelligence from other leading AI models including Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o. Available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app, it is also available via API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. That\u2019s not it! The most impressive feature this time is the new Artifacts feature that allows you to interact with AI-generated content in a dynamic workspace. Key Highlights: Superior Performance: Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama-3 400B (early snapshot results) in various benchmarks, including graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), MMLU, math (MGSM and GSM8K), and coding (HumanEval). Speed and Cost: It operates twice as fast as Claude 3 Opus, making it ideal for complex and real-time tasks. Despite its speed and intelligence, it costs the same as Claude 3 Sonnet, at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. Vision Capabilities: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard vision benchmarks such as visual math reasoning (MathVista), chart understanding (ChartQA), and document understanding (DocVQA). Agentic Coding: In an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of coding problems, significantly higher than Claude 3 Opus\u2019s 38%. This makes it highly effective for tasks that require understanding and improving open-source codebases. Artifacts Feature: When you ask Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside your conversation. This is a dynamic workspace where you can see, edit, and build upon Claude\u2019s creations in real-time. Safety and Privacy: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is classified as an AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) model, indicating rigorous safety evaluations. UK and US AI Safety Institutes have tested it to ensure robust performance and adherence to safety standards."}}

\n The executives of OpenAI look like guilty marvel characters in the above picture. Mr. Altman, there\u2019s a robot for you on the other line. Sam Altman says being fired from OpenAI by his own board was a blessing in 2023, I wonder if indebted Americans will feel the same way about AI taking their job in 2024 and 2025? While OpenAI tries to talk about AGI or ASI, the reality is in 2024 we are likely to see many more layoffs directly due to their GPT technology. A not insignificant number of these will be due to AI and many of those will be directly related to ChatGPT and its products. That Microsoft decided to fund such a project to get first access to their tech, that will directly lead to many job layoffs is not very good for their reputation moving forwards. The lobbying against this being revealed has already begun. While OpenAI makes exciting claims and promises about its technology, even in a 'soft landing' scenario, AI will continue to take more jobs. Not to mention how America\u2019s choices have wreaked havoc to economies from China to Germany, some of the world\u2019s more important economies. America\u2019s gains in 2023 and 2024, are going to be the world\u2019s pains. What a just world OpenAI is bringing to us. But what about layoffs due to A.I.? This year I\u2019ve covered many reports on the future of jobs. This even as OpenAI does its best to distract us from the key concerns. But how many job losses and layoffs will OpenAI be directly responsible for next year in 2024 in America and abroad, or in the 2020s itself and the future at large? While the U.S. might not release that data, it\u2019s going to be a considerable and increasing number. Here\u2019s why:"}}

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # Elon Musk to Deploy Humanoid Robots for Internal Use in Tesla Factories by Next Year \n Elon Musk said on Monday that Tesla will have humanoid robots in \"low production\" for the company's internal use next year.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army \u2013 necessary to gather data and improve its underlying model \u2013 K-Scale is outsourcing its hardware design so hobbyist engineers can build their own pint-sized assistants. It\u2019s a clever approach that may help robotics develop the kind of vibrant open-source structure that has allowed AI models to improve rapidly. Adagy Robotics illustrates the ancillary economy that may blossom around the robotics revolution. The Y Combinator startup functions as a kind of roadside assistance for robots, taking over malfunctioning machines. As robots proliferate, support services like Adagy may become increasingly important. Physical Intelligence recently raised $70 million to build a universal brain for robotics. Though its product is still under wraps, the startup has assembled a remarkable team, led by Karol Hausman, who co-authored Google\u2019s original RT-2 research paper. Physical Intelligence intends for its software to be used across different form factors, making it the \u201cultimate generalist,\u201d according to co-founder Lachy Groom. Open questions. Should robots look like humans? Many of the buzziest players in the space have chosen to build \u201chumanoid\u201d robotics. Though on the shorter and lighter side (usually around 5\u20195 and 130 pounds), they are recognizably human with legs, arms, and fingers. Are humans the optimal form factor? On the one hand, much of our world has been explicitly built for humans \u2013 if you design a robot that is too big, it might not be able to navigate existing doors, passageways, or vehicles. On the other, we have our limitations. If we had eight arms instead of two or forty fingers, what might we be able to accomplish? Will robots \u201cevolve\u201d into strange new form factors? AI can help design robots, as well as make them run. Recent research at Northwestern University showed how AI can create novel robot bodies when a clear goal is set. Asked to produce a specimen that can \u201cwalk,\u201d the researcher\u2019s AI model concocted a blob with squishy, irregular legs punctuated by seemingly random holes. It worked. Strangely, it struggled when the researcher tried to remove the holes from the design. The researchers dubbed this process \u201cinstant evolution.\u201d It illustrates AI\u2019s unique, occasionally inexplicable \u201ccreativity.\" Robots of the future may look more like an alien species than facsimiles of ourselves. What is the best \u201crobot-native\u201d business model? Although hardware costs are declining, buying a robot outright is expensive. Will Amazon and other large customers choose to buy machines outright? Will they lease them similar to a car? Might they simply \u201chire\u201d them, as you would any other worker? Or should robotics companies give them away for free, receiving a portion of the efficiency gains captured as recompense? The coming years will reveal which model best meets commercial realities. How does the robotics boom impact US-China geopolitical tensions? It\u2019s unclear which superpower will benefit from the \u201cdemographic dividend\u201d of a robotic population surge. As it stands, China leads the world in the number of installed industrial robots, with nearly 300,000. That\u2019s over 7x more than the United States. However, the leading companies call America home. Given FBI Director Christopher Wray\u2019s warning last week about China\u2019s ability to cripple American infrastructure through technological means, it\u2019s essential America captures this dividend and sets global standards. Is this a \u201cproductive bubble?\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell. But it looks like it could become one. If venture interest swells as expected, tens of billions of capital will flood the sector. While that might result in irrational valuations that experience a hard correction, it could also brute force progress. In particular, a bubble may drive production efficiencies (driving down the price to make a robot), increase the number of robots deployed (radically increasing available training data), and test the appropriate applications and form factors. When the bubble pops, we might be left with real progress: well-trained, low-cost robotics with clear commercial value. Downstream impacts. Hardware flourishes. The robotics boom will breathe new life into hardware. As robots increase in capability, the number of possible form factors will increase, especially as we search for ideal use cases. We may have small, scuttering robots to clean our floors, monkey-like climbers to wash windows, and spindle-fingered spiders to rapidly sort packages. Even if humans prove to be the ideal wrapper, a range of configurations is possible, opening up a vast new design space. In many respects, it is another example of AI getting a \u201cbetter body.\" A different kind of \u201cmigrant\u201d crisis. One slightly provocative reading of the robot population surge is as a modern migrant crisis: an influx of new workers is emerging to Steal Our Jobs\u2122. We expect some of the same rhetoric and pressure points to appear, exacerbating existing class tensions. While some displaced workers may be able to upskill and find better-paying and more desirable employment, others will struggle. Both public and private sector solutions will be needed to support those at the bottom of the pyramid. Better working conditions. Robots are well-suited to tackle humanity\u2019s most dangerous tasks. While that might result in the obsoletion of perilous career paths, on the bright side, it may also allow workers to avoid the worst parts of their existing jobs. We have already seen this play out in the military with drones and other automated assets, reducing human jeopardy. In the future\n######################\noutput:"}}

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # What I learned from the UN\u2019s \u201cAI for Good\u201d summit \n This story originally appeared in The Algorithm, our weekly newsletter on AI.

But it's still unclear exactly how. Dust is on a mission to figure that out. Since LLMs won't be of much help in the enterprise if they don't have access to internal data, Dust has built a platform that indexes, embeds, and keeps updated in real-time companies' internal data (Notion, Slack, Drive, GitHub) to expose it to LLM-backed products.\nDust co-founders Gabriel Hubert and Stanislas Polu sold a company to Stripe and worked there for five years. They witnessed firsthand how fast-growing companies can struggle with scale. They've seen what they call \"information debt\" creep in, and they're now focused on applying LLMs to solve some of the major pain points associated with that. They're currently exploring the following applications on top of their platform:\nAnswer engine. The focus is on factuality, as it's a key to broad adoption.\nCompositional assistant. Templated assistance at the time of content creation. For example, generate the paragraph you're missing based on internal data.\nDocuments that update themselves. Document owners receive notifications and a pre-crafted recommendation each time a piece of information that should update their document floats through the company.\nStructured event extraction. Users can generate structured events from unstructured data (e.g., a Slack thread) based on predefined templates.\nInternal data monitoring. Monitor enterprise data with intelligent rules. For example, receive alerts if personally identifiable information (PII) inadvertently ends up where it should not be.\nIt's a lot, but Dust's founders believe most of these streams will ultimately contribute to one coherent product. They're still in the early days of their exploration and are forming the final focused picture of what Dust will be. Based on their initial iterations, they believe they've confirmed their core hypothesis: that knowledge workers can be augmented (not replaced) with LLM applications that have access to company data, and a new kind of \"team operating system\" can be built for that.\n- Konstantine Buhler, Partner at Sequoia\n######################\noutput:"}}

relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n how to build RAG systems that actually generate business value. Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3. Complex Problem Solving - Qwen2-Math can tackle a wide range of mathematical tasks, from basic arithmetic to challenging competition-level problems. Think IMO Shortlist and even the International Zhautykov Olympiad!\n\n4. Availability - The suite of models is available on Hugging Face, GitHub, and Modelscope.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text document that are relevant to the activity and match them with the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages).\n\nHere's the output:\n\n* No entities in the text document match the given list of entity<|>Country seeking to release hostages). The text appears to be discussing mathematical models, benchmarks, and Olympiads, which are unrelated to the provided list.\n\nIf you'd like me to assist with anything else, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n# CHEAT SHEET: ENTERPRISE AI TERMINOLOGY \n Here's a cheat sheet of key enterprise AI terms covering role-based access control, turnkey solutions, retrieval-augmented generation, and more.\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided text document and entity types, I will generate the output in the specified format.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE AI<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Key enterprise AI terms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to access control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURNKEY SOLUTIONS<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to solutions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION<|>TECHNOLOGY<|>Enterprise AI term related to generation)\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no relationships mentioned in the text, I didn't generate any relationship records. Also, the entity types provided were not explicitly mentioned in the text, so I assumed the most relevant type for each entity.\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext: # How I Gained 100K Followers in Under 3 Months \n _As someone who's built a thriving online business from scratch, I know firsthand how game-changing the right strategies can be._ After losing nearly everything in the FTX crypto collapse, I was determined to rebuild stronger than ever.

And what kinds of defenses? \n What kinds of threats do generative AI systems contain and how might we defend against or mitigate them? That's the subject of a new paper born out of a workshop held at Google in June of this year. The researchers who contributed to the paper come from Google, the University of Wisconsin, University of California, San Diego, University of Maryland, College Park, University of California, Berkeley, University of Waterloo University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, Stanford University, DARPA, the Center for AI Safety, Aura Labs. The motivation for the paper is that today's large-scale AI systems are sufficiently powerful that they either compound or create new threats to safety. Some of the key risks posed by generative AI technologies include: Improved 'spear-phishing' attacks Aiding the creation and dissemination of deepfakes Increasing the amount of cyberattacks being conducted by making it easier for people to do them (e.g, via code models) Reducing the barrier-of-entry for adversaries generally - general technologies make things generally cheaper. Data poisoning - you can generate and insert bad data into an environment that other people train on, silently corrupting systems. The authors also list some ways in which generative AI systems can be used to give us more defenses against these attacks. These include: Systems for detecting LLM-generated content. Systems for watermarking the outputs of generative models broadly. Using code models to perform automated penetration testing to help strengthen complicated, digital infrastructures. Multimodal analysis; use the multimodal capabilities of AI models to do complex analysis on potential attackers, such as by identifying bot accounts on social media The paper concludes with some ideas for what we should do to generally increase the safety of both the AI ecosystem and the wider world.\n######################\noutput:"}}

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here. Otherwise let\u2019s dig into the various stages that go into a Retrieval\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I'll identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.\n\n**Extracted Entities:**\n\n1. **RAG** (MODEL) - Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n2. **Deepfakes** (MODEL) - a type of AI-generated media\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n5. **GraphRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n6. **AgenticRAG** (MODEL) - a specific type of RAG system\n\n**Extracted Relationships:**\n\n1. **RAG** is related to **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** (TYPE)\n2. **Deepfakes** is related to **AI-generated media** (TYPE)\n3. **Knowledge Intensive RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n4. **Multi-Modal RAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n5. **GraphRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n6. **AgenticRAG** is a subtype of **RAG** (MODEL)\n\nNote that there are no entities or relationships extracted from the provided entity list, as they seem to be unrelated to the text document. If you'd like me to process the entire entity list, please let me know!\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n the model is deployed. Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests. Iterate: Return to step 1\n------------------------\noutput:\nBased on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify entities in the text and link them to their corresponding types.\n\nHere is the output:\n\n(\"entity\" \"model\" \"MODEL\")\n##\n(\"entity\" \"MLOps engineers\" \"PERSON\")\n##\n\nNote: Since there are no explicit mentions of organizations, companies, products, events, technologies, publications, or websites in the provided text, only two entities were identified: \"model\" (linked to entity type \"MODEL\") and \"MLOps engineers\" (linked to entity type \"PERSON\").\n#############################\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nentity_types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\ntext:\n-3.1-405B on benchmarks like GSM8K, Math, MMLU-STEM, OlympiadBench, and CollegeMath - a serious contender in the mathematical reasoning arena.\n\n3.

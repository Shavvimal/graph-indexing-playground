-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [book, event, organization, person, technology, sector, investment_strategy, project, product, government_agency, initiative, platform, startup, conference, research_team, hospital, algorithm, framework, goal, company, funding]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

Example 1:

entity_types: [book, event, organization, person, technology, sector, investment_strategy, project, product, government_agency, initiative, platform, startup, conference, research_team, hospital, algorithm, framework, goal, company, funding]

# 10 New Ecommerce Books for Summer 2024 (2 Minute Read) 
 A round-up of recent titles that present fresh takes on marketing strategy, economics and finance, AI, startups, Amazon, and more. These include Simple Marketing for Smart People, The 10-Second Customer Journey, and Think Like a Brand – Act Like a Startup.
------------------------
output:
Based on the provided data, I will identify entities in the text and match them with the given entity types.

Here is the output:

{record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}Simple Marketing for Smart People{tuple_delimiter}BOOK{tuple_delimiter}Book title)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}The 10-Second Customer Journey{tuple_delimiter}BOOK{tuple_delimiter}Book title)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}Think Like a Brand – Act Like a Startup{tuple_delimiter}BOOK{tuple_delimiter}Book title)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}Amazon{tuple_delimiter}COMPANY{tuple_delimiter}Company name)
{record_delimiter}

Note: Since the text does not contain any entities that match the other entity types (event, organization, person, technology, sector, investment_strategy, project, product, government_agency, initiative, platform, startup, conference, research_team, hospital, algorithm, framework, goal), they are not included in the output.

However, navigating the benefits and risks of AI in mental health poses complex challenges that require careful consideration and ethical oversight. [Read More]
------------------------
output:
Based on the provided entity list and text document, I will identify the entities mentioned in the text and their corresponding types.

Here is the output:

("entity"{tuple_delimiter}ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE{tuple_delimiter}TECHNOLOGY{tuple_delimiter}AI technology)
{record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}MENTAL HEALTHCARE{tuple_delimiter}SECTOR{tuple_delimiter}Mental health sector)

Note: The entities identified are "Artificial Intelligence" (technology) and "Mental Healthcare" (sector).

# How to Bring Machine Learning Projects 
 Join this virtual event to learn how Gretel and Lambda Labs together unlock faster experimentation so teams can easily vet approaches, fail fast, and be much more agile in delivering an LLM solution that works. To build a successful machine learning product, you need to understand how to manage a machine learning project. This takes a lot of soft skills, from product discovery passing by the project planning and finally the execution, there is a lot more to building a machine learning solution than just knowing some algorithms! Machine learning is all about developing models? Think again! Machine learning is risky and costly, and we cannot get started on a project without planning, coordination, and collaboration. Here is my typical template for leading a machine learning project to success. Here are the critical steps, but each project may need some adjustment depending on the specificity of the project. Product Discovery: What is the size of your market, and for what ML solution? Like any business endeavor, building new software
------------------------
output:
Based on the provided text document and entity list, I will extract relevant entities and relationships.

**Extracted Entities:**

1. **Gretel** (organization)
2. **Lambda Labs** (organization)
3. **Machine Learning** (technology)
4. **LLM solution** (product)

**Extracted Relationships:**

1. **Gretel** and **Lambda Labs** are collaborating on a project to unlock faster experimentation in machine learning.
2. **Machine Learning** is a technology used in the development of **LLM solutions**.

Note that there are no entities or relationships mentioned in the text that match the provided list of entity types (e.g., book, event, person, etc.). The extracted entities and relationships are based on the content of the text document.

text:
 insights during the listening sessions are calling the results a disappointment, lacking vision, a delay of much-needed regulation, and a missed opportunity to act when much of the world already has. Schumer was clear that U.S. domination of AI is the goal, referring during the press conference to the $32 billion as “surge emergency funding to cement America’s dominance in AI,” including “outcompeting China.” The money would go to R&D, infrastructure, funding the outstanding CHIPS and Science Act, a series of “AI Grand Challenge” programs, and dozens of other government agencies and AI-related initiatives. Delaying regulation certainly helps U.S. tech companies—especially dominant players, which argue that regulation would “stifle innovation”—to do so.
------------------------
output:
Based on the provided text document and entity list, I will identify and extract relevant entities and relationships.

**Extracted Entities:**

1. **PERSON**: Schumer
2. **GOVERNMENT_AGENCY**: U.S. government agencies (multiple)
3. **INITIATIVE**: AI Grand Challenge programs
4. **COMPANY**: U.S. tech companies (multiple, but no specific names mentioned)
5. **COUNTRY**: China
6. **COUNTRY**: America (referring to the United States)

**Extracted Relationships:**

1. **GOAL**: Schumer - U.S. domination of AI
2. **FUNDING**: $32 billion - R&D, infrastructure, CHIPS and Science Act, AI Grand Challenge programs, government agencies, and initiatives
3. **REGULATION**: Delaying regulation - helps U.S. tech companies (especially dominant players)
4. **COMPETITION**: America - outcompeting China in AI

Please let me know if you would like me to extract any additional information or clarify the extracted entities and relationships!

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [idea, intellectual property, founder, equity, startup, commitment, risk, market, patent, technology, company, investment, funding, product, revenue, customer, business model, legal document, shareholder, agreement, pitch, elevator pitch, value proposition, mission statement, vision statement, problem statement, economic moat, market validation, minimum viable product, pre-seed funding, seed funding, series A funding, series B funding, venture capital, angel investor, co-founder, early adopter, customer acquisition, revenue model, pricing strategy, intellectual property protection, trade mark, copyright, design registration, trade secret, patent]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into The primary language of the provided text is **English**., just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

erâsvalue contribution.

### Idea/Intellectual Property

This category includes who came up with the original idea and any
contributionsanyone has made in creating specific intellectual property (IP).
The person with the idea should, of course, getsome equity. But depending on
the nature of the startup, the IP may be more valuable. For example, in aSaaS-
based company, coding the first iteration of the backend will be more valuable
than creating a businessplan and marketing deck for how to scale the eventual
product. Both are valuable, but youâll need to decide theweight each should
get as a team according to your market.

### Commitment & Risk

Commitment asks you to consider whether a founder is full-time versus half-
time.Risk includes financial, emotional, mental, and reputational
considerations that someone is giving up to enterstartup life.

 over a
concept](https://www.antler.co/academy/how-to-register-trade-mark), youâve
got an enormously powerful moat that becomes hard to scale. When Amazon
successfully patented one-click checkouts in 1999, it immediately established
a very deep moat. The sheer convenience of one-click checkouts speaks to the
very core of e-commerce.Â

Apple, for example, pays Amazon what we all assume must be a fortune for that
technology concept. It has to, because otherwise the app store simply would
not work. Amazonâs patent will eventually expire, but not before Amazon used
its moat to build the business behind it to an almost impossible scale.

IP rights are as compelling as patents. Here's a quirky example: A Japanese
company called Crypton created a digital voice bank that allowed users to
input words, and the voice would âsingâ them, allowing the user to create

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

Claude 3.5 Sonnet has a context window of 200k tokens, and improves upon both speed and intelligence from other leading AI models including Claude 3 Opus and GPT-4o. Available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app, it is also available via API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. That\u2019s not it! The most impressive feature this time is the new Artifacts feature that allows you to interact with AI-generated content in a dynamic workspace. Key Highlights: Superior Performance: Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforms Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama-3 400B (early snapshot results) in various benchmarks, including graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), MMLU, math (MGSM and GSM8K), and coding (HumanEval). Speed and Cost: It operates twice as fast as Claude 3 Opus, making it ideal for complex and real-time tasks. Despite its speed and intelligence, it costs the same as Claude 3 Sonnet, at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. Vision Capabilities: The model delivers state-of-the-art performance on standard vision benchmarks such as visual math reasoning (MathVista), chart understanding (ChartQA), and document understanding (DocVQA). Agentic Coding: In an internal evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of coding problems, significantly higher than Claude 3 Opus\u2019s 38%. This makes it highly effective for tasks that require understanding and improving open-source codebases. Artifacts Feature: When you ask Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside your conversation. This is a dynamic workspace where you can see, edit, and build upon Claude\u2019s creations in real-time. Safety and Privacy: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is classified as an AI Safety Level 2 (ASL-2) model, indicating rigorous safety evaluations. UK and US AI Safety Institutes have tested it to ensure robust performance and adherence to safety standards.\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3:70b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

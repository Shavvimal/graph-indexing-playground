Our method capitalizes on the generative prior of text-to-image models known for photorealism, employing a scalar value and instructions to alter low-level material properties. Addressing the lack of datasets with controlled material attributes, we generated an object-centric synthetic dataset with physically-based materials. Fine-tuning a modified pre-trained text-to-image model on this synthetic dataset enables us to edit material properties in real-world images while preserving all other attributes. We show the potential application of our model to material edited NeRFs.\nMindSearch: Mimicking Human Minds Elicits Deep AI Searcher - Abstract: Information seeking and integration is a complex cognitive task that consumes enormous time and effort. Inspired by the remarkable progress of Large Language Models, recent works attempt to solve this task by combining LLMs and search engines. However, these methods still obtain unsatisfying performance due to three challenges: (1) complex requests often cannot be accurately and completely retrieved by the search engine once (2) corresponding information to be integrated is spread over multiple web pages along with massive noise, and (3) a large number of web pages with long contents may quickly exceed the maximum context length of LLMs. Inspired by the cognitive process when humans solve these problems, we introduce MindSearch to mimic the human minds in web information seeking and integration, which can be instantiated by a simple yet effective LLM-based multi-agent framework. The WebPlanner models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process: it decomposes the user query into atomic sub-questions as nodes in the graph and progressively extends the graph based on the search result from WebSearcher. Tasked with each sub-question, WebSearcher performs hierarchical information retrieval with search engines and collects valuable information for WebPlanner. The multi-agent design of MindSearch enables the whole framework to seek and integrate information parallelly from larger-scale (e.g., more than 300) web pages in 3 minutes, which is worth 3 hours of human effort. MindSearch demonstrates significant improvement in the response quality in terms of depth and breadth, on both close-set and open-set QA problems.\n\"Do Anything Now\": Characterizing and Evaluating In-The-Wild Jailbreak Prompts on Large Language Models - Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) has drawn significant attention from the general public and LLM vendors. One particular type of adversarial prompt, known as jailbreak prompt, has emerged as the main attack vector to bypass the safeguards and elicit harmful content from LLMs. In this paper, employing our new framework JailbreakHub, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of 1,405 jailbreak prompts spanning from December 2022 to December 2023. We identify 131 jailbreak communities and discover unique characteristics of jailbreak prompts and their major attack strategies, such as prompt injection and privilege escalation. We also observe that jailbreak prompts increasingly shift from online Web communities to prompt-aggregation websites and 28 user accounts have consistently optimized jailbreak prompts over 100 days. To assess the potential harm caused by jailbreak prompts, we create a question set comprising 107,250 samples across 13 forbidden scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, our experiments on six popular LLMs show that their safeguards cannot adequately defend jailbreak prompts in all scenarios. Particularly, we identify five highly effective jailbreak prompts that achieve 0.95 attack success rates on ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and the earliest one has persisted online for over 240 days. We hope that our study can facilitate the research community and LLM vendors in promoting safer and regulated LLMs.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Entities\n(\"entity\"<|>ALCHEMIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Alchemist is a research group or organization that proposed a method to control material attributes of objects using diffusion models)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MINDSEARCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MindSearch is a framework that mimics human minds in web information seeking and integration, using a multi-agent LLM-based approach)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAILBREAKHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JailbreakHub is a framework used to analyze jailbreak prompts and their attack strategies on large language models)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a popular large language model developed by OpenAI, specifically versions GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-3.5<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT-3.5 is a version of the large language model developed by OpenAI, used in ChatGPT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GPT-4<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GPT-4 is a version of the large language model developed by OpenAI, used in ChatGPT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBPLANNER<|>PERSON<|>WebPlanner is a component of MindSearch that models the human mind of multi-step information seeking as a dynamic graph construction process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEBSEARCHER<|>PERSON<|>WebSearcher is a component of MindSearch tasked with performing hierarchical information retrieval with search engines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NERFS<|>EVENT<|>NeRFs (Neural Radiance Fields) are a potential application area for the Alchemist model, focusing on material editing in real-world images)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models used for various tasks, including information retrieval and generating human-like text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAILBREAK PROMPTS<|>EVENT<|>Jailbreak prompts are adversarial prompts designed to bypass safeguards in large language models and elicit harmful content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROMPT INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>Prompt injection is a major attack strategy used in jailbreak prompts to manipulate large language models)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PRIVILEGE ESCALATION<|>EVENT<|>Privilege escalation is another attack strategy used in jailbreak prompts to gain unauthorized access or capabilities in large language models)\n\n## Relationships\n(\"relationship\"<|>ALCHEMIST<|>NERFS<|>Alchemist's method can be applied to material edited NeRFs<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINDSEARCH<|>WEBPLANNER<|>WebPlanner is a component of MindSearch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MINDSEARCH<|>WEBSEARCHER<|>WebSearcher is a component of MindSearch<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAILBREAKHUB<|>JAILBREAK PROMPTS<|>JailbreakHub analyzes jailbreak prompts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GPT-3.5<|>GPT-3.5 is a version of ChatGPT<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHATGPT<|>GPT-4<|>GPT-4 is a version of ChatGPT<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAILBREAK PROMPTS<|>PROMPT INJECTION<|>Prompt injection is a strategy used in jailbreak prompts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAILBREAK PROMPTS<|>PRIVILEGE ESCALATION<|>Privilege escalation is a strategy used in jailbreak prompts<|>8)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

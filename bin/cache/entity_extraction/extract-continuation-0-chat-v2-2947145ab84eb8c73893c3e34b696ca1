Utilities are considered a cheaper alternative to high-cost tech stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google. According to the International Energy Agency, AI services like ChatGPT use about 2.9 watt-hours per search, significantly more than the 0.3 watt-hours used for standard searches. The International Energy Agency projects global data center power demand could hit 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, doubling 2022 levels and matching Germany's total power consumption. The S&P 500 Utilities index has risen 10.4% year-to-date, outpacing the broader market, while the State Street Select Utilities SPDR ETF has climbed 15.3%. The surge in power demand has driven utilities like Edison International to raise annual capital spending from $6B to $8B. U.S. electricity consumption, previously growing at under 0.5% annually over the past two decades, is expected to rise by 2.4% annually until 2030.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The International Energy Agency provides data and projections on global energy consumption, including the impact of AI services on electricity demand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AI service that uses about 2.9 watt-hours per search, significantly more than standard searches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GERMANY<|>GEO<|>Country whose total power consumption is projected to be matched by global data center power demand by 2026)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S&P 500 UTILITIES INDEX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Index that tracks the performance of utility stocks, which has risen 10.4% year-to-date)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STATE STREET SELECT UTILITIES SPDR ETF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Exchange-traded fund that has climbed 15.3% year-to-date, reflecting the surge in utility stocks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EDISON INTERNATIONAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Utility company that has raised its annual capital spending from $6B to $8B due to increased power demand)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVIDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-cost tech stock considered less favorable compared to utility stocks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-cost tech stock considered less favorable compared to utility stocks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>High-cost tech stock considered less favorable compared to utility stocks)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<|>CHATGPT<|>The International Energy Agency provides data on the electricity consumption of AI services like ChatGPT<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY<|>GERMANY<|>The International Energy Agency projects that global data center power demand could match Germany's total power consumption by 2026<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S&P 500 UTILITIES INDEX<|>STATE STREET SELECT UTILITIES SPDR ETF<|>Both the S&P 500 Utilities index and the State Street Select Utilities SPDR ETF have shown significant gains year-to-date<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EDISON INTERNATIONAL<|>S&P 500 UTILITIES INDEX<|>Edison International is a utility company that contributes to the performance of the S&P 500 Utilities index<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA<|>MICROSOFT<|>Both Nvidia and Microsoft are high-cost tech stocks considered less favorable compared to utility stocks<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVIDIA<|>GOOGLE<|>Both Nvidia and Google are high-cost tech stocks considered less favorable compared to utility stocks<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>GOOGLE<|>Both Microsoft and Google are high-cost tech stocks considered less favorable compared to utility stocks<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

This follows Woodside\u2019s $1.2B purchase of U.S. LNG developer Tellurian in late July, part of its global LNG expansion strategy, while OCI, led by Nassef Sawiris, is divesting assets as part of a broader strategic review. The Beaumont-based Texas project is set to become one of the largest blue ammonia facilities, with an annual production capacity of 1.1 million tonnes. Blue ammonia, made from gas with captured carbon, is a key solution for decarbonizing industries such as trucking and shipping. OCI's strategic review and asset sales were driven by activist investor Jeff Ubben, who bought a 5% stake and advocated for better shareholder returns. The company has sold two fertilizer assets for around $3.6B each to Adnoc and Koch Industries and plans to return at least $3 to shareholders this year. OCI\u2019s shares have dropped 17% this year, reducing its market value to $5.14B, while Woodside\u2019s shares have fallen 20%, bringing its market value to $34B.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

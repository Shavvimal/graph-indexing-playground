Same-store sales declined by 1%, with Pizza Hut and KFC experiencing a 3% drop. KFC's U.S. same-store sales fell 5%, and international sales dropped 3%, although China showed growth. Pizza Hut\u2019s same-store sales fell 1% in the U.S. and 4% internationally. Taco Bell saw a 5% rise in same-store sales, driven by its value reputation and growth across all income groups. Yum Brands aims to deploy artificial intelligence in Taco Bell drive-thrus at hundreds of U.S. locations by year-end. Around 200 Yum restaurants in the Middle East, Malaysia, and Indonesia are temporarily closed, with some possibly reopening soon, but facing a risk of permanent closures if conflicts escalate.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Yum Brands is a multinational fast food corporation that owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PIZZA HUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pizza Hut is a subsidiary of Yum Brands, known for its pizza and Italian-American cuisine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KFC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>KFC, also known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, is a subsidiary of Yum Brands specializing in fried chicken)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TACO BELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands, known for its Mexican-inspired fast food)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>Country where KFC showed growth in same-store sales)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIDDLE EAST<|>GEO<|>Region where around 200 Yum restaurants are temporarily closed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALAYSIA<|>GEO<|>Country where around 200 Yum restaurants are temporarily closed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INDONESIA<|>GEO<|>Country where around 200 Yum restaurants are temporarily closed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS<|>EVENT<|>Yum Brands' financial performance report for the second quarter, showing mixed results)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>PIZZA HUT<|>Pizza Hut is a subsidiary of Yum Brands<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>KFC<|>KFC is a subsidiary of Yum Brands<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>TACO BELL<|>Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>SECOND-QUARTER RESULTS<|>Yum Brands' second-quarter results showed mixed financial performance<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KFC<|>CHINA<|>KFC showed growth in same-store sales in China<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>MIDDLE EAST<|>Around 200 Yum restaurants in the Middle East are temporarily closed<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>MALAYSIA<|>Around 200 Yum restaurants in Malaysia are temporarily closed<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>YUM BRANDS<|>INDONESIA<|>Around 200 Yum restaurants in Indonesia are temporarily closed<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

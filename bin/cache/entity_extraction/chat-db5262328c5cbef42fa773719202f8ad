Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, model, company, product, event, technology, publication, website, startup]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more). To do so, we will look at the excellent \u201cSearching for Best Practices in Retrieval-Augmented Generation\u201d and other good publications in the space. Given the nature of the source, we will revert from the usual tl;dr and then elaborate format, to instead discuss everything together. The rest of this article will be a discussion of the engineering of RAG systems, so if you\u2019re not interested in the technical details, you can click off here.

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

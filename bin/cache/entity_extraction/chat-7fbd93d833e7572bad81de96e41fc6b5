The company, led by Robin Rombach, Patrick Esser, and Andreas Blattmann, has secured $31 million in seed funding, with Andreessen Horowitz leading the investment round. FLUX.1 comes in three variants, all boasting 12 billion parameters and a hybrid architecture of multimodal and parallel diffusion transformer blocks. The launch of FLUX.1 is seen as a significant milestone in the democratization of powerful AI tools, with the potential to reshape the AI industry and influence the debate about open-source versus closed-source development models.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

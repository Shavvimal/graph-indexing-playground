Identify all entities.

LLM Paper Reading Notes\u200a\u2014\u200aAugust 2024 Every month, Jean David Ruvini posts his notes on LLM/NLP related papers, and every month I share his notes here. JD has been doing cutting-edge NLP at scale for a while, so his insights are very valuable. Given how many people want to stay cutting edge in NLP- and how hard it is to know what to focus on- domain specific sources like JD are a godsend- Sharing short notes (from myself and others) about LLM research papers I came across in July. These notes differ in their level of detail and precision. I hope they\u2019re still useful in piquing your curiosity and helping you breathe under the waterfall. At the current pace of AI, it takes the power of all of us to keep up.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JEAN DAVID RUVINI<|>PERSON<|>Jean David Ruvini is an expert in NLP who posts monthly notes on LLM/NLP related papers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLM PAPER READING NOTES\u200a\u2014\u200aAUGUST 2024<|>EVENT<|>A monthly event where Jean David Ruvini shares his notes on LLM/NLP related papers)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JEAN DAVID RUVINI<|>LLM PAPER READING NOTES\u200a\u2014\u200aAUGUST 2024<|>Jean David Ruvini is the author of the LLM Paper Reading Notes for August 2024<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

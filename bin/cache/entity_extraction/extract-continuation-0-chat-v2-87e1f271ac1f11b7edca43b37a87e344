We investigate how vocabulary size impacts LLM scaling laws by training models ranging from 33M to 3B parameters on up to 500B characters with various vocabulary configurations. We propose three complementary approaches for predicting the compute-optimal vocabulary size: IsoFLOPs analysis, derivative estimation, and parametric fit of the loss function. Our approaches converge on the same result that the optimal vocabulary size depends on the available compute budget and that larger models deserve larger vocabularies. However, most LLMs use too small vocabulary sizes. For example, we predict that the optimal vocabulary size of Llama2\u201370B should have been at least 216K, 7 times larger than its vocabulary of 32K. We validate our predictions empirically by training models with 3B parameters across different FLOPs budgets. Adopting our predicted optimal vocabulary size consistently improves downstream performance over commonly used vocabulary sizes. By increasing the vocabulary size from the conventional 32K to 43K, we improve performance on ARC-Challenge from 29.1 to 32.0 with the same 2.3e21 FLOPs. Our work emphasizes the necessity of jointly considering model parameters and vocabulary size for efficient scaling.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LLMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI models used for natural language processing tasks, trained on large datasets with numerous parameters)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLAMA2-70B<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Llama2-70B is a specific large language model with 70 billion parameters, used as an example in the study to demonstrate the impact of vocabulary size on performance)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARC-CHALLENGE<|>EVENT<|>ARC-Challenge is a benchmark used to evaluate the performance of language models on challenging natural language understanding tasks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ISOFLOPS ANALYSIS<|>EVENT<|>IsoFLOPs analysis is a method proposed in the study to predict the compute-optimal vocabulary size for large language models)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DERIVATIVE ESTIMATION<|>EVENT<|>Derivative estimation is another method proposed in the study to predict the compute-optimal vocabulary size for large language models)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARAMETRIC FIT OF THE LOSS FUNCTION<|>EVENT<|>Parametric fit of the loss function is a third method proposed in the study to predict the compute-optimal vocabulary size for large language models)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLAMA2-70B<|>LLMS<|>Llama2-70B is an example of a large language model (LLM) discussed in the study<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARC-CHALLENGE<|>LLAMA2-70B<|>Llama2-70B's performance was evaluated using the ARC-Challenge benchmark<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ISOFLOPS ANALYSIS<|>LLMS<|>IsoFLOPs analysis is a method used to optimize the vocabulary size for large language models<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DERIVATIVE ESTIMATION<|>LLMS<|>Derivative estimation is a method used to optimize the vocabulary size for large language models<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARAMETRIC FIT OF THE LOSS FUNCTION<|>LLMS<|>Parametric fit of the loss function is a method used to optimize the vocabulary size for large language models<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}

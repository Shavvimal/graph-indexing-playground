The lawsuit, filed in a Northern California federal court, alleges that OpenAI and its co-founders, Sam Altman and Greg Brockman, violated the company's founding agreement by prioritizing commercial interests over public welfare. Musk had previously withdrawn his initial lawsuit without providing a reason, just a day before a judge was due to decide on its dismissal. The lawsuit contends that Altman and Brockman deviated from their original commitment to develop artificial intelligence responsibly for the benefit of humanity when they entered into a multi-billion dollar partnership with Microsoft.\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

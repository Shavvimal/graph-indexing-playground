Given how comprehensive this topic can be, I will split it into a series (similar to the one we just did on Deepfakes). Today\u2019s piece will cover the overview of the general principles, which will then form the basis of our other explorations into more advanced/specific topics (Knowledge Intensive RAG, Multi-Modal RAG, GraphRAG, AgenticRAG, and much more).

Test in production: Is your model actually good? Testing in production is the only way you can determine if your model is providing the expected value. The pipelines to perform A/B testing and Canary deployments need to be carefully designed to quickly detect if a model is unexpectedly underperforming and remove it without harming the user experience or revenue. This is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Monitoring in Production: What about if your model deteriorates tomorrow? In production, everything can happen! Data or concepts can shift. Servers can break. The software can have undetected bugs. You need to monitor those different components and implement plans of action (automated or not) as fallback mechanisms in case something gets wrong. This work is typically done in collaboration with MLOps engineers. Documenting: The most critical step nobody likes! This part of the work might be the most underrated part of a project, along with writing unit tests.

Over the next decade, intelligent, embodied androids will permeate industrial activities and aspects of everyday life, from assembling cars to folding laundry. The impending robot \u201cpopulation boom\u201d is the result of technological breakthroughs, intense investor appetite, labor cost arbitrage, and long-standing demographic trends. Modern AI models have changed the game. The same deep learning and neural techniques that have powered the generative AI revolution are helping robotics overcome one of its major limitations: a lack of training data. In the past, if you wanted to teach a robot to pick up a yellow block and place it in a blue bin, it had to learn through trial and error or extensive videos. New foundation models allow robots to learn from online text, images, and videos. Generative AI can create new data to tackle edge cases. One of the challenges of operating in the physical world is the sheer volume of strange, niche possibilities. While AI thrives in decoding the fixed rules of chess or language patterns, it has historically struggled to account for real-world edge cases. Not only do new models help with this kind of \u201cthinking,\u201d they can also create new, relevant data to train on. Investors are looking for the next bonanza. Venture capitalists have aggressively invested in AI over the past few years, pouring billions into companies making new foundation models or building applications on top of them. As some of those well-capitalized startups close their doors, there is a growing itch to find the next great AI opportunity. Robotics is the beneficiary. Robots aren\u2019t that fussy about pay. A recent MIT study attempted to paint a rosy portrait of AI\u2019s impact on the workforce by saying \u201conly\u201d 23% of wages paid would be \u201ceconomically viable\u201d to automate. That figure will only increase as hardware costs decline and robots become increasingly intelligent. California\u2019s decision to raise the minimum wage for fast food workers to $20 an hour and other similar initiatives may accelerate the shift. Major economies lack sufficient working humans. America doesn\u2019t have a large enough working-age population to support its young and elderly. The increase in the US\u2019s \u201cdependency ratio\u201d is not unique \u2013 many other advanced countries face similar slumps. While immigration is one solution, robots are another. What can new robots do? Google\u2019s RT-2 model best demonstrates what this new class of robotics is capable of. When an engineer prompted Google\u2019s test robot to select the \u201cextinct animal\u201d from a range of dollar store figurines it had never seen before, it correctly selected a plastic dinosaur. The model\u2019s ability to adapt to a new environment with new variables, generalize, and reason is novel and opens up huge possibilities. Modern robots are no longer constrained to a narrow pre-programmed problem. Beyond RT-2, a range of robotics makers are demonstrating commercial utility across sectors from logistics to manufacturing to construction. Who are the major players? Google\u2019s cutting-edge RT-2 model demonstrates the search monolith\u2019s impressive AI research bonafides. Its DeepMind division is driving the technology forward and will continue to play a vital role. While we wouldn\u2019t expect Google worker robots any time soon, autonomous vehicle subsidiary Waymo illustrates how the company applies artificial intelligence in the physical world. OpenAI disbanded its robotics division in 2021, citing a lack of progress. It remains an important player in the space, investing in startups like Figure and Physical Intelligence. After being cut loose, OpenAI\u2019s robotics team founded Covariant, a maker of a robotics \u201cbrain\u201d and physical setups for sorting items, assembling them into kits, and more. Amazon is a long-time customer and acquirer in the robotics space. After acquiring Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, the firm created a dedicated Amazon Robotics division that has continued investing in the space and trialing new solutions. Amazon is conducting one such trial with Agility, maker of the \u201cDigit\u201d humanoid robot, which it touts as \u201cthe first human-centric, multi-purpose robot made for logistics work.\u201d Agility seems confident there\u2019s demand for its products, announcing a plan to produce 10,000 per year via a new \u201cRoboFab\u201d in Oregon. Tesla\u2019s \u201cOptimus\u201d robot attracted skepticism when first unveiled, but it seems to be improving quickly. Earlier this year, Elon Musk shared a video of Optimus gently folding a shirt, displaying its dexterity. On a recent earnings call, Musk said he expected Optimus to be operational in Tesla\u2019s factories before the end of the year and available for purchase by 2025. Figure, 1X, Agility, Apptronik, and Sanctuary are all building humanoid robotics, some of which are finally ready to leave their home factory and find gainful employment. Figure\u2019s 5\u20196 worker is headed to BMW\u2019s production lines and, as mentioned, Agility is sending its units off to Amazon. Apptronik\u2019s androids are slated for a longer journey: via a partnership with NASA, the company intends to send its robots to space to assist astronauts. What about Boston Dynamics? Though no one makes better sizzle reels of robot parkour, Boston Dynamics has struggled to find commercial applications for its dexterous machines. In many ways, they represent the pinnacle of old-world robotics: extremely well-tuned machines that struggle to generalize or solve new problems. Who else should you keep an eye on? Monumental is reversing the construction industry\u2019s \u201cproductivity collapse\u201d with non-humanoid robots. The Netherlands-based startup recently raised $25 million to develop its automated bricklayers further and disrupt this massive, sleepy industry. In the long run, Monumental hopes its technology will reduce housing costs and reignite the production of beautiful, well-crafted buildings. K-Scale Labs is building child-sized humanoid robots that cost as little as $8,000. To reduce the capital costs of spinning up an android army\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "llama3:70b", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}, "history": null}

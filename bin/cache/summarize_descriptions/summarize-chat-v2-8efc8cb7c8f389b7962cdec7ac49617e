{"result": "MindSearch is a framework that mimics human minds in web information seeking and integration, using a multi-agent large language model (LLM)-based approach. It functions as an AI search engine framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) such as GPT and InternLM2.5-7b-chat to answer complex queries. MindSearch achieves this by analyzing hundreds of web pages and enhancing factual accuracy through a dynamic graph construction process.

# GraphRAG

- [ ] Manage updating the Graph with new data without re-indexing
- [ ] Check Backlinks from Updates
- [ ] Write a visualisation script
  - See the streamlit app in the demo. You can see the communities, view the summaries on another tab. You can also click in to see the sources of the relationships, nodes and also the data used to make the response.
  - Critical for using this data
  - Think about using a second agent to provide a verification evaluation based on the provided context to see if there are any hallucinations in the returned response. Helps with after the fact analysis on if the response was correctly grounded or not
- [ ] Hook into exisitng workflow to continuously update the Graph
  - CRON
  - Index all my AI news data and set up a CRON job to update it
- [ ] Link it to my own twitter
- [ ] Do this for Podcasts and create a marketing thing
  - throw it at the transcripts for a deep podcast list - you could really pick out connections between concepts that you didn't see initially

# Getting Started

[Prompt Tuning](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/prompt_tuning/auto_prompt_tuning/):

```bash
python -m graphrag.prompt_tune --root ./bin --domain "Artificial Intelligence" --limit 150
```

There were a lot of issues while doing this, namely the prompt used to get the language to insert "English" into sentences would include the LLM preamble "Sure, The main language I see in this text is English" so when the prompts were formatted, would make the final prompt not make sesne. This has been manually edited. 

The examples have also been manually edited, the entities have been hand chosen from my knowledge of the data, and the prompts from the tuning output seem different from the baseline prompts. Maybe they are out-dated? Either way, I have manually done promtp editing. 

[Indexing](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/index/2-cli/):

```bash
python -m graphrag.index --verbose --root ./bin
```

- `--resume <output-timestamp>`: if specified, the pipeline will attempt to resume a prior run. The parquet files from the prior run will be loaded into the system as inputs, and the workflows that generated those files will be skipped. The input

Query with [Global](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/query/0-global_search/):

```bash
python -m graphrag.query --root . --method global "What are the top 5 companies in the AI space?"
```

Query with [Local](https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/posts/query/1-local_search/):

```bash
python -m graphrag.query --root . --method local "What is OpenAI, and what are the main relationships?"
```

# Visualise

Can use the Notebook I've added. I need to see if I can get the visualise python script they have left in the package to work.
